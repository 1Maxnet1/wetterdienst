Introduction
************

This section explains how to use `wetterdienst` as a Python library, client interface or
HTTP API. Everything is based on the API so whether you call the service or HTTP API
they will use the same API in the background. The API section explains our API for the
example of the German Weather Service (DWD) and contains extra sections for individual
methods being used by either of the provided weather services.
